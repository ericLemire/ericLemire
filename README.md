## 📚 My Story So Far

I've always been enamored by the way technology and design intersect to create something interesting. I started by learning C# but as I discovered the potential of mobile applications, I switched gears and dived deep into Swift.

During this transition, I developed and maintained several iOS apps. I was proud to have 5 of my apps published on the Apple App Store.

Life threw me the beautiful curveball of parenthood, which meant stepping back from coding for a while. Now that I'm back, I'm fully committed to developing further in order to become a professional application developer.
